Hello everyone! I'm thrilled to share my latest project, where I've harnessed the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

What Iâ€™ve Achieved:
ðŸ”¹ Sentence Embeddings: Utilizing BERT to generate high-quality embeddings that capture the meaning of sentences for various NLP tasks.

ðŸ”¹ Multi-Task BERT Model: Developed a model that handles multiple tasks simultaneously, specifically:

Sentence Classification: Identifying the category of a given sentence.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Detecting and classifying entities in text.

ðŸ”¹ Efficient Training: Implemented advanced techniques like layer-wise learning rates and selective freezing/unfreezing of layers to optimize training.

ðŸ”¹ Transfer Learning: Leveraged pre-trained language models and fine-tuned them for specific tasks, achieving high accuracy even with limited data.

Task 1: Sentence Transformer Implementation

Task 2: Multi-Task Learning Expansion

Task 3: Training Considerations

Task 4: Layer-wise Learning Rate Implementation

I'm excited to see how this can be applied in real-world scenarios. Your feedback and thoughts are always welcome.
